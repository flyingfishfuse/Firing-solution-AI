# Firing-solution-AI
CUDA/Python/Tensorflow/ARMA3/DCS:World : training a computer to kill, one game at a time.

New project, training a AI to kill shit for me so I can focus on flying the chopper.
  * take a frame every so often
  * identify the people/vehicles/buildings/potential explosive materials
  * each "identified thing" is a seperate programmatic entity
  * if the identified target is moving, apply frame prediction to that "thread of identity"
  * lead the target, bullets have a travel time, should try to calculate that as well.
  * apply a higher level heuristic containing the coditional logic applying the "THREE RULES"... modified of course.
